### Preprocessors

A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax.

**Popular CSS preprocessors:**

* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [LESS](https://lesscss.org/)
* [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)

#### Advantages

* automate repitive tasks
* backward capability

#### Disadvantages

* needs to be "compiled" leading to slower development times
* potentially produce large CSS files
* Developer knowledge.  Each preprocessor has its own syntax
